### Improvements:

- Visit only unique links
    - For 'parent' and 'child' links, do not visit a link that has already been visited. For example, social links are available on every page of a company's website. Resources are wasted by queueing these for crawling when they will be a part of the crawl queue on the first instance anyway

- Present links on a different interface
    - A console application is the fastest to develop but a web application might present this information in a more organized and navigable format
